## Thomas Lawrence

I am a software engineer and artist. I just acheived a distinction in a Masters course in Virtual and Augmented Reality at Goldsmiths College. Currently, I work for crowdfunding firm Republic where I lead a team to deliver regulatory software. Furthermore I founded a startup Imaginespace which explores Virtual Reality and art. 

Human and machine interaction has the potential to revolutionise society both creatively and functionally. My ambition is to help manifest this potential using state of the art Machine Learning and Mixed Reality. I am particularly excited by using technology to create entirely novel solutions and experiences. 

## Work Experience

Seedrs x Republic (Oct 2021 - Present)  
Software Engineer

Seedrs X Republic is a equity crowfunding and venture captial firm where I work as a fullstack engineer. I started as a platform engineer maintaining and building a large monolithic financial system. The platform handles sensitive operations involving client assets and money. I was promoted to the lead of the regulations team. We were responsible for updating the platform to be compliant with new FCA regulations in a fixed timeframe. Furthermore we were in charge of satisfying EU regulations so the firm could expand into Europe.

- I worked on a payment integration project with automated payment provider Banked. This allowed users to pay through automated bank transfer which is more convenient than using a card through stripe or a manual bank transfer.
- I maintained and built software to handle client money and asset operations. These involved some of the most exciting startups and venture capital institutions in Europe. We handled mergers, acquisitions and floatations.
- I built a first of its kind drawdowns investment product for venture capital fund Atomico. Allowing retail investors to invest in venture capital funds through the Seedrs platform. The investment process was split into multiple tranches where automated payments were collected and processed from users and assets distributed. The complexity here was investigating how a large financial monolithic application could handle a new investment process.
- I was promoted to the lead of the FCA UK regulation team. We were tasked with updating the Seedrs platform to satisfy FCA regulations by a fixed deadline. Both our deadlines were acheived and we successfully passed an external regulatory audit. The project involved managing and motivating a team whilst translating specifications from stakeholders in compliance to technical solutions.
- After completing the FCA regulations, I led the team in updating the platform to satisfy a new set of European regulations. This allowed Republic to offer investment oppurtunities to European investors. Again this project involved meeting tight deadlines as the whole company was focused on European expansion. A large part of the project involved internationalisation and localistation of the website which was difficult owing to the multiple sources of content in the ecosystem. We successfully satisfied the regulations on time.

Homeflow (Oct 2019 - Jul 2021)  

Seedrs x Republic (Oct 2021 - Present)  
Software Engineer

Homeflow is a property tech company where I worked as a backend engineer in Ruby on Rails. I honed my software skills maintaining a large distributed microservice infastructure. 

- I led project to craft a database API to be used by external clients including the largest estate agency group in the UK Connells. This led to a multi-million pound deal with Connels being completed.
- I configured and built applications on a Docker Container Network.
- I led a project to allow articles for multiple sites to be loaded through a Database API. This project included implementing multi-layered caching and overhauling legacy software.
- I worked on a project for property withing certain geographical boundaries using geoqueries.

## Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Imaginespace           | Imaginespace is a startup I founded to make high quality Virtual Reality accessible. We created a web based tool to generate 360 art galleries to share across the web. We also curate virtual spaces for a range of artists and creatives. The tool is available at [imaginespace.io](/imaginespace.io). | Processing, Java, P5.js, Javascript, React, Redux, Render.com |
| Dr. Dolittle VR | Dr. Dolittle VR is a Unity based Virtual Reality game where players use a language of body gestures to communicate with virtual animals. The game uses interactive machine learning to detect the gestures; the library InteractML developed at Goldsmiths implements the machine learning. The application emulates multi-sensory Dance and Movement Therapy where animal responses stimulate players to move and dance! | C#, Unity, InteractML              |
| Dancing Puppet Tom | Dancing Puppet Tom is an experiment exploring how machine learning can interpret the movement of the human body. A time-series transformer is trained to animate a puppet dancing in two distinct styles. The model is trained using footage of my own dancing. This explores the relationship between artificial intelligence and the authenticity of my own movement. Here are links to the code on Google Colab and the datasets on Huggingface. | Python, Google Colab, Tensorflow, P5.js, Huggingface, Ml5             |
| Dragon Shadow | Dragon Shadow is a physical computing project where users collaboratively dance a dragon silhouette by rotating smartphones. This combines the ancient art of shadow play with modern technology. A Rasberry Pico microcontroller is used to control the puppet and rotational data is sent from the iPhones via Open Sound Control. | Rasberry Pico, C++, OSc, GyroOSC, TouchDesigner             |
| The Colour Mixing Machine | A webapp to do y. | Ruby              |
| Musical Trees | A webapp to do y. | Ruby              |
| SleepLa | A webapp to do y. | Ruby              |
| Mushroom Picking AR | A webapp to do y. | Ruby              |

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill


## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team
